The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane and has a relatively close vehicle, `256`, ahead at a distance of `19.22 m`, travelling at a faster speed (`16.42 m/s`) than the ego-vehicle (`11.79 m/s`). This proximity suggests that maintaining the current speed might lead to a decreasing TTC, potentially becoming unsafe.

The right lane offers no chance for a safe lane change due to vehicle `392` being quite close (`8.04 m` behind) and travelling at a much faster speed (`18.90 m/s`). Therefore, changing to the right is unsafe at this moment as per the utility analysis.

Accelerating is deemed unsafe as it could exacerbate the risk of collision with vehicle `256` ahead given the short distance and the fact that `256` is already moving at a higher speed.

Keeping Idle is also considered unsafe because the current speed does not mitigate the risk of collision with vehicle `256` as it is moving away faster, while the ego-vehicle might still reduce the gap due to differential acceleration rates.

Deceleration is identified as the safest course of action. It will increase the distance between the ego-vehicle and vehicle `256`, allowing for a safer TTC while still keeping the ego-vehicle in its current lane to evaluate the possibility of changing lanes safely in the future.

Final action: `#### 4`
