The first step is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front. In your lane, vehicle `256` is `29.82 m` ahead, traveling at `16.88 m/s`, whereas your speed is `8.32 m/s`. The Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated as the relative distance divided by the relative speed (if positive). Here, the TTC with the car in front is larger than 4, allowing some flexibility for speed adjustments.

Next, we consider right lane changing. According to the information provided, changing to the right lane is deemed unsafe because the vehicle `392` is only `6.14 m` ahead traveling at a much higher speed (`19.16 m/s`). Thus, there is not enough space for a safe lane change. Additionally, behind the ego-vehicle, vehicle `440` is also traveling faster and closing the distance. Hence, a right lane change is not feasible as it may cause a collision.

Given these circumstances, deceleration is the next best action to ensure safety and maintain appropriate headway from the vehicle `256` in your current lane while preparing for possible future lane changes once conditions improve.

Even though you can't change lanes right now and being too close to vehicle `256`, it's safe and recommended to decelerate your speed, which is confirmed by the action utility analysis.

Final action: `#### 4`
