The ego-vehicle is currently in the third lane from the left, and the goal is to move towards the rightmost lane. However, the right lane change is deemed unsafe due to the presence of vehicle `688`, which is very close behind in the right lane (only `0.72 m` away).

The ego-vehicle's current speed is `10.63 m/s`. Ahead in the same lane, vehicle `624` is only `22.49 m` away, traveling faster at `17.53 m/s`. This proximity, combined with its faster speed, makes maintaining TTC larger than 4 a concern that could lead to a potential collision if no action is taken.

Considering the safety analysis, deceleration is recommended to increase the distance to the car ahead and maintain a safe speed difference. Both right lane changes and acceleration are unsafe due to potential collision risks and insufficient space with surrounding vehicles.

Final action: `#### 4`
