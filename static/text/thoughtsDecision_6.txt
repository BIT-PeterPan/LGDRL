The first priority is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the vehicle in front. The vehicle ahead on the leftmost lane (`256`) is only `21.16 m` away and traveling at `14.28 m/s`, which is considerably slower than the ego-vehicle's speed of `21.05 m/s`. Thus, maintaining the current speed could lead to a potential collision, since the TTC (Time to Collision) is not adequate.

Attempting a right lane change is considered unsafe as per the Action Utility Analysis, indicating the potential for collision. Thus, changing lanes now is not advisable.

With the currently available actions and guidelines that prioritize safety (keeping an appropriate distance from the car ahead and avoiding unsafe lane changes), the action that ensures the safety and prepares for a possible safe lane change later is to decelerate.

Final action: `#### 4`
