The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which is where it needs to be. Therefore, no lane change is needed.

The vehicle ahead of you in the current lane is `32.62 m` away and is moving at a speed of `18.85 m/s`, which is faster than your current speed of `11.79 m/s`.

There is room for acceleration according to the action utility analysis, as we are too far from the vehicle ahead, suggesting that accelerating is a safe and recommended option.

The TTC (Time to Collision), calculated by the relative speed and distance, is larger than 4 seconds, which makes acceleration safe and justified.

Therefore, the correct and recommended action is to accelerate to catch up to the car ahead and maintain an appropriate distance and speed.

Final action: `#### 3`
