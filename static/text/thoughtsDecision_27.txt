The first step is to evaluate the distance and speed difference with the car in front of the ego-vehicle. Vehicle `392` is ahead by `50.67 m` with a speed of `19.45 m/s`, whereas the ego-vehicle is traveling at `14.11 m/s`. The Time-to-Collision (TTC) can be calculated, but given the speeds and distances, it's over 4 seconds, indicating safe distance and speed.

Secondly, the goal is to change to the right lane when possible, but the analysis indicates that the maneuver would be unsafe due to the presence of vehicle `624` only `7.58 m` ahead in the right lane.

Since the right lane change is not safe, and given the recommendation that accelerating is optimal in this situation because you are too far from the vehicle in front, acceleration is considered the best option to close the gap safely, maintaining the ability to change lanes in the future when safe and continuing progress toward the designated area.

Final action: `#### 3`
