Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, it should remain in this lane according to step 3.  

Next, we evaluate the distance and speed difference with the car in front. Vehicle `688` is ahead at a distance of `43.14 m` with a speed of `19.55 m/s`. The ego's current speed is `18.74 m/s`. There is an opportunity to safely accelerate to slightly close the gap and still maintain a safe distance.

Checking TTC (Time To Collision) with the vehicle ahead:
TTC with `688` = Distance / Relative Speed = 43.14 / (19.55 - 18.74) = 43.14 / 0.81 â‰ˆ 53.27 seconds, which is much greater than 4 seconds. Hence, it is safe to accelerate.

Finally, the Action Utility Analysis suggests accelerating as optimal because the ego-vehicle is too far from the vehicle ahead, and it is safe and recommended.

Final action: `#### 3`
