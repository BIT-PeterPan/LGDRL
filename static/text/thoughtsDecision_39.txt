To make a decision, let's analyze the situation according to the steps:

1. Maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front of you. 
   - Vehicle `624` is `46.60 m` ahead, traveling slightly faster than the ego-vehicle (`17.83 m/s` vs `10.63 m/s`). The distance is sufficient, and the Time to Collision (TTC) is larger than 4 seconds, so the current distance is appropriate.

2. Consider a right lane change if safe.
   - The action utility analysis indicates that changing to the right lane is safe and recommended.
   - In the right lane, Vehicle `688` is `23.85 m` ahead, traveling much faster than the ego-vehicle (`18.52 m/s`), which facilitates the lane change.
   - Vehicle `784` is behind in the right lane at a safe distance of `27.86 m`, also traveling faster (`17.10 m/s`) than the ego-vehicle.
   - Therefore, there is sufficient space in the current lane and the right lane to perform a safe lane change.

3. If already in the rightmost lane, maintain position. Currently, the ego-vehicle is not in the rightmost lane, so this doesn't apply.

According to the guidelines and observations above, performing a right lane change is both safe and fulfills the objective. 

Final action: `#### 2`
