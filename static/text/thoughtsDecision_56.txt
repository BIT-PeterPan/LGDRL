The ego-vehicle is currently driving in the rightmost lane and the main goal is to maintain safety while navigating through traffic.

Firstly, we consider the distance and speed difference with the vehicle in front (Vehicle `688`), which is `23.63 m` ahead, traveling at `20.06 m/s`. The ego-vehicle is going at `26.84 m/s` and the distance is close, indicating that adjustments need to be made to ensure safety and maintain an adequate time-to-collision (TTC) greater than 4 seconds.

Secondly, the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, which means there is no need to change lanes.

Based on the Action Utility Analysis, decelerating is recommended as it is the safest option to avoid getting too close to Vehicle `688`. Accelerating is unsafe due to the risk of collision, and maintaining speed (Idle) is also considered unsafe.

Final action: `#### 4`
