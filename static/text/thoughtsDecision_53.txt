1. Assess the distance and time-to-collision (TTC) to Vehicle `688` ahead of the ego-vehicle. Vehicle `688` is `34.41 m` ahead and traveling at a slower speed (`19.94 m/s` compared to your `25.68 m/s`). The TTC is approximately (34.41 / (25.68 - 19.94)) = 5.85 seconds, which is greater than 4 seconds, satisfying the TTC condition.
   
2. You are already in the rightmost lane, so there's no need to change lanes. The priority is to stay in this lane.

3. Since you are in the correct lane and there is a recommendation to accelerate as there is still a considerable distance to the vehicle ahead, check if acceleration is an appropriate action considering safe distance is maintained.

4. Accelerating will help close the gap between the ego-vehicle and the target to maintain an appropriate speed difference.

Final action: `#### 3`
