The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane with a vehicle (256) ahead at a distance of `18.38 m`, traveling at a slower speed of `14.64 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `19.89 m/s`, resulting in a speed difference of `5.25 m/s`. This is too close, potentially leading to a collision if maintained. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that the Time-To-Collision (TTC) remains larger than 4 seconds.

The possibility of changing to the right lane exists, but it is considered unsafe as the vehicles on the right lane present a potential collision risk. Vehicle `344` is ahead at a distance of `38.06 m`, and vehicle `392` is behind at a distance of `18.03 m`.

Considering the action utility analysis:
- An Idle action is unsafe due to the closeness of vehicle `256`.
- An acceleration action is also unsafe and could lead to a collision.
- A right lane change action is unsafe due to insufficient space.

Given the proximity to the vehicle ahead and the unsafe nature of changing lanes or maintaining speed, the best course of action is to decelerate.

Final action: `#### 4`
