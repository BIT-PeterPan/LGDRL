Firstly, I need to evaluate the distance and speed difference with the car in my lane, ahead of me, which is Vehicle `392`. The distance to Vehicle `392` is `53.87 m`, and my speed is `12.95 m/s` while the speed of Vehicle `392` is `19.46 m/s`. There is a safe Time-To-Collision (TTC) because the other vehicle is moving significantly faster, but according to Action Utility Analysis, deceleration is recommended to avoid getting too close.

Secondly, since the goal is to move to the rightmost lane safely, I should check the right lane situation for a potential lane change. However, there is Vehicle `624` just `9.51 m` ahead of me in the right lane with a speed of `17.00 m/s`, which renders a right lane change unsafe.

Since I'm not currently in the rightmost lane and the right lane change is unsafe, I must consider adjusting my speed instead. The utility analysis recommends deceleration in my current lane to maintain a safe proximity to Vehicle `392` ahead.

Finally, given these considerations, my optimal action is to decelerate because right lane change is unsafe right now, and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead is crucial.
  
Final action: `#### 4`
