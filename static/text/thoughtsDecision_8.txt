The ego-vehicle is currently too close to the vehicle `256` ahead with a distance of `16.35 m` while driving at a speed of `18.74 m/s` and the surrounding vehicle `256` has a slower speed of `14.98 m/s`. This means the Time To Collision (TTC) is undesirably low and needs correction.

Considering the appropriate TTC, there's a need to increase the distance from the vehicle ahead. Therefore, accelerating or staying idle is unsafe as it may lead to a collision.

An attempt to change to the right lane is deemed unsafe according to the Action Utility Analysis, likely due to insufficient space and potential collisions with the vehicles `344` and `392` present in the adjacent lane.

The safest and most recommended action is to decelerate to maintain a safe following distance and to increase the TTC beyond the minimum requirement of 4 seconds.

Final action: `#### 4`
