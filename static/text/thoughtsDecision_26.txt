The first step is to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front of us while keeping the TTC (Time to Collision) larger than 4 seconds. The vehicle ahead in our lane is `47.94 m` away and has a higher speed of `19.44 m/s` compared to our speed of `12.95 m/s`. Therefore, there is no immediate risk of collision, and the TTC is greater than 4 seconds. Thus, we are safe in terms of distance and speed difference with the car in front.

The second step is to attempt a right lane change safely if we are not already in the rightmost lane. Currently, we are in the second lane from the left, and we are not in the rightmost lane. We need to check if we can change lanes to the right safely. However, according to the Action Utility Analysis, changing to the right lane is unsafe due to potential collision as the vehicle ahead in the right lane is just `6.20 m` away. Therefore, we cannot change to the right lane at this time.

Since we cannot change lanes to the right, we can consider other options. The Action Utility Analysis recommends accelerating because we are too far from the front vehicle, and accelerating could help us cover more ground towards the rightmost lane where our target area is. Additionally, accelerating is considered safe.

Final action: `#### 3`
