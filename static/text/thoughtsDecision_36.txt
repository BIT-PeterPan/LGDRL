Based on the current driving situation, I need to evaluate the most appropriate action for safety and goal achievement.

Firstly, assess the distance and speed relative to the car ahead in the current lane. The ego-vehicle is travelling at `9.47 m/s`, and the vehicle ahead (Vehicle `624`) is at a distance of `35.25 m`, travelling at a speed of `17.71 m/s`. Since the car ahead is moving faster and there's still a reasonable gap, the Time to Collision (TTC) calculation is advantageous for now but close to requiring attention.

Secondly, consider the potential for a right lane change. The vehicle (Vehicle `688`) in the right lane ahead is `11.85 m` away and travelling at `17.89 m/s`, which is significantly faster than the ego-vehicle. Given that the analysis indicates a collision risk, a lane change to the right is currently unsafe. Therefore, the action of changing to the right lane is not advisable at this moment.

Ensure compliance with the rightmost lane directive, which cannot be pursued safely at present.

Considering the utility analysis provided, while accelerating and idling are safe actions, decelerating is recommended to increase the gap with the car ahead, preventing any risk due to the increasing proximity. A decrease in speed can also help in preparing for a future right lane change when feasible.

Thus, the safest and recommended action based on the current scenario and priority towards maintaining a safe following distance is to decelerate.

Final action: `#### 4`
