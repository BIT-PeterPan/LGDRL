We are currently traveling in the second lane from the left with a vehicle ahead of us, Vehicle `392`, with a distance of `59.80 m`. Our speed is `12.95 m/s`, and the speed of vehicle `392` is `19.47 m/s`. Therefore, the time to collision (TTC) is `(59.80 / (19.47 - 12.95)) â‰ˆ 10.92`, which is sufficiently greater than the threshold of 4. This means maintaining distance and speed with vehicle `392` is acceptable.

Our main objective is to safely reach the rightmost lane where the target is located. We are currently not in the rightmost lane and should evaluate the possibility of changing to the right lane.

In our right lane, there is Vehicle `624` ahead at a distance of `13.11 m` and traveling at a speed of `17.26 m/s`. There is also Vehicle `48` behind us in the right lane at a distance of `37.38 m` traveling at a speed of `16.27 m/s`. 

For a safe right lane change:
- Vehicle `624` needs to have sufficient distance for us to merge safely, however, only `13.11 m` in front of us indicates it might be too close given their speed.
- Vehicle `48` also needs to be considered, being `37.38 m` behind us; this is sufficient distance for a lane change.

As per Action Utility Analysis, the right lane change is recommended and deemed safe. We need to analyze if we can alter our speed for a better position to merge right.

Considering our speed is lower than that of both vehicles in our current lane and the right lane, increasing speed would create more favorable merging conditions by increasing our distance from Vehicle `624`.

Final action: `#### 3`
