We start by evaluating the distance and speed difference with the car in front of the ego-vehicle on its current lane (Vehicle `624`). The distance to Vehicle `624` is `42.95 m`, and it travels at `17.80 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `9.47 m/s`. The speed difference is `8.33 m/s` (calculated as 17.80 - 9.47), which means the ego-vehicle is slower than Vehicle `624`. This is a safe distance and speed difference for maintaining safe travel behind Vehicle `624`.

Next, we consider the option to perform a right lane change. The analysis indicates that changing to the right lane is safe and recommended. Upon evaluating the available space in the right lane, we observe that Vehicle `688` is `19.90 m` ahead, but traveling at a faster speed of `18.33 m/s`. This speed difference indicates that Vehicle `688` will continue to move away from the ego-vehicle, increasing the available space. Additionally, Vehicle `784` is `31.08 m` behind in the right lane, traveling at `16.83 m/s`. This confirms there will be sufficient room for a right lane change, as both the forward and rear distances are appropriate for making this maneuver.

Given the conditions for lane change are safe, executing a right lane change is the most appropriate decision as it safely moves the ego-vehicle towards the target, located in the rightmost lane.

Final action: `#### 2`
