The ego-vehicle is in the rightmost lane, confirming that it doesn't have the option for a right lane change.

Next, evaluate the distance and speed difference with the car ahead in the same lane:

- The distance to Vehicle `688` is `39.51 m`, and its speed is `19.84 m/s`, while the ego-vehicle is traveling at `23.37 m/s`.

- The speed difference is `3.53 m/s` (23.37 - 19.84), calculating TTC (Time to Collision):
  \[
  \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed Difference}} = \frac{39.51}{3.53} \approx 11.19 \, \text{seconds}
  \]
  This TTC value is safe as it is greater than 4.

Since the ego vehicle is in the rightmost lane and should stay in this lane according to rule 3.

Action Utility Analysis supports accelerating because it is a recommended action to close the gap with the vehicle ahead more efficiently. The vehicle capacity provides a safe distance, and accelerating helps maintain appropriate following behavior.

Final action: `#### 3`
