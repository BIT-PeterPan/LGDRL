Given the current situation, the ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane and the target is in the rightmost lane. Since the objective is to reach the rightmost lane, the ego-vehicle should ideally perform lane changes to the right when safe to do so.

Firstly, analyze the surrounding environment:
- No vehicle is detected in the current lane, leaving it free.
- For the right lane, Vehicle `344` is ahead with a distance of `38.13 m` and a speed of `22.29 m/s`. This is relatively safe as it maintains a lead over the ego-vehicle.
- Vehicle `392` is behind in the right lane with a minimal distance of `1.12 m`, which poses a risk for immediate lane change due to its proximity.

Assessing the Action Utility Analysis:
- Lane change to the right is deemed unsafe due to the high risk of collision with Vehicle `392`.
- Accelerating is safe and recommended to catch up, likely to create the possibility of a future lane change by increasing the speed difference with Vehicle `392`.

Conclusion based on the available actions:
- Immediate lane change to the right is too risky; therefore, follow the action utility's recommendation to accelerate.
- Accelerating will help prepare for a safer lane change in subsequent evaluations, by creating more favorable distance with Vehicle `392`.

Final action: `#### 3`
