Given the scenario and considering the following details:

1. **Distance and Speed with Car Ahead in Current Lane:** 
   - Vehicle `256` is ahead at a distance of `36.88 m` with a speed of `17.13 m/s`.
   - Our current speed is `10.63 m/s`.
   - Time to collision (TTC) needs is large enough; let's consider ensuring space for right lane change.

2. **Right Lane Change Consideration:**
   - We are not in the rightmost lane and aim to reach the rightmost lane.
   - Distance between our vehicle and Vehicle `392` in the right lane is `15.42 m` ahead and with a speed of `19.27 m/s`.
   - With Vehicle `440` behind in the right lane at `40.37 m` traveling at `18.17 m/s`.
   - Right lane change is deemed safe and recommended from the utility analysis.

3. **Action Analysis:**
   - Changing to the right lane is prioritized since our goal is to safely reach the rightmost lane.
   - While idle, acceleration or deceleration is safe, changing directly when safe is the fastest way to eventually reach and drive in the rightmost lane.

Given these considerations, taking into account the current position and safe opportunity for changing lanes:

Final action: `#### 2`
