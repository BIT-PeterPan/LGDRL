Considering you are already in the rightmost lane, fulfilling the condition to stay in this lane, let's assess more factors:

1. **Appropriate Distance and Speed Difference with the Car in Front:**  
   - Vehicle `688` is `38.21 m` ahead in the same lane moving at `19.13 m/s`.
   - Your speed is `14.11 m/s`, so Vehicle `688` is faster than you.
   - The time to collision (TTC) with vehicle `688` is not serious as the speed difference is `5.02 m/s` in favor of `688`.
  
2. **Right Lane Change:**  
   - A right lane change is not possible because there is no lane on the right. Thus, check this off your list of possibilities. You should remain in the current lane.

3. **Stay in the rightmost lane:**  
   - This condition is satisfied since you are already in the rightmost lane.

Given the analysis, and considering that you are not too close to the vehicle in front and there is no risk of collision due to relative speeds (vehicle `688` is moving faster), accelerating is suitable here to reduce the gap slightly towards a more optimal spacing.

Final action: `#### 3`
