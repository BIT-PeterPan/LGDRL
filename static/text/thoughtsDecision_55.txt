Based on the information provided, the ego-vehicle is currently driving in the rightmost lane and needs to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

1. Analyze the distance and speed difference: 
   - The ego-vehicle is `27.08 m` behind the vehicle ahead in the same lane, with a speed of `28.00 m/s` while the vehicle ahead is moving at `20.02 m/s`. This indicates a need to decelerate to maintain a safe distance and respect the TTC constraint of being larger than 4.

2. Lane position and safe actions:
   - The ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, and there is no lane to the right, eliminating the option to move right.
   - Since deceleration is marked as safe and recommended action (to avoid collision and increase TTC), it should be prioritized over other options.

3. Final decision based on Action Utility Analysis:
   - Deceleration is the only safe and viable action recommended to maintain safety, given the unsafe conditions for acceleration or maintaining current speed.

Final action: `#### 4`
