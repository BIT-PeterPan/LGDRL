The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane and the target location is also in this lane. According to the goal, when the ego-vehicle is in the rightmost lane, it should stay in this lane.

The vehicle ahead in the same lane (`Vehicle `688``) is at a distance of `35.67 m` with a speed of `19.00 m/s`. The ego-vehicle is traveling at `12.95 m/s`, creating a significant speed difference with the vehicle ahead. The action utility analysis suggests that accelerating is safe and recommended due to the large distance from the front vehicle.

Since you are already in the right lane and should maintain this position, there's no need to change lanes.

Final action: `#### 3`
