Firstly, we observe that Ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane, and the goal is to gradually move toward the rightmost lane safely.

Checking the current speed and distance with Vehicle `256` in front, we notice the distance is `22.09 m` and the vehicle ahead is moving faster (`16.59 m/s`) than the ego-vehicle's speed (`10.63 m/s`). This means the time-to-collision (TTC) is increasing as the distance grows, but still, the current distance is very short which may cause risk.

According to Action Utility Analysis, acceleration is considered unsafe. This is due to close proximity with Vehicle `256` making it wise to avoid increasing speed. Similarly, IDLE is marked as unsafe, likely due to maintaining the gap might close down rapidly because of the slower speed.

Checking the possibility of right lane change, a vehicle `392` is very close behind in the adjacent right lane (only `3.94 m` away), making the right lane change unsafe.

With this evaluation, and since Deceleration is noted as safe and recommended to avoid getting too close to the front vehicle, the best suitable action while maintaining safety and adherence to the lane-changing strategy is to decelerate.

Final action: `#### 4`
