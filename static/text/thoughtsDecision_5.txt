The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane at a speed of `22.21 m/s`.

The vehicle ahead of the ego-vehicle in the same lane is vehicle `256`, which is `24.72 m` ahead and moving with a speed of `13.87 m/s`.

The TTC (Time to Collision) can be calculated as follows:
TTC = Distance / Relative Speed = `24.72 m` / (`22.21 m/s` - `13.87 m/s`) = 24.72 / 8.34 = approximately 2.96 seconds.

The TTC is below the safe threshold of 4 seconds, indicating that the ego-vehicle is too close to vehicle `256` and needs to decelerate to increase the time gap.

Attempting to change to the right lane is deemed unsafe based on the information from the Action Utility Analysis. The distances and speeds indicate the risk of collision if such a maneuver is attempted.

Based on the analysis, maintaining speed (Idle) or accelerating are unsafe options due to the close proximity to vehicle `256`. These options could increase the risk of collision.

Decelerating is advised to ensure a safer gap and an increased TTC to the vehicle ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
