The ego vehicle is currently in the second lane from the left and has a car ahead of it (Vehicle `392`) at a distance of `56.60 m`. The velocity difference is substantial, as you are traveling at `14.11 m/s` while Vehicle `392` is moving at `19.46 m/s`. This situation implies you are maintaining an acceptable distance with the vehicle in front.

The right lane change is considered unsafe, as Vehicle `624` is only `11.05 m` ahead and traveling at `17.14 m/s`, which does not provide the necessary safe space for a lane change, violating Step 2's safety check.

The car behind you in your current lane (Vehicle `440`) is at a safe distance, and no immediate threat is posed by the surrounding traffic.

Given the unsafe condition of changing to the right lane and to maintain an appropriate speed to avoid coming too close to Vehicle `392`, deceleration is recommended. This action aligns with Action Utility Analysis, which notes the need for deceleration to increase the distance from the front vehicle safely.

Final action: `#### 4`
