Given the scenario, here is the decision-making process for the autonomous vehicle:

1. **Evaluate Distance and Speed:**
   - The ego-vehicle is currently `28.92 m` behind vehicle `256` in the same lane, which is traveling at `14.27 m/s` with negative acceleration (`-`2.00 m/s`^2`).
   - The Time-To-Collision (TTC) can be approximately calculated.  
     \[
     \text{Relative Speed} = 23.37 - 14.27 = 9.10 \text{ m/s}
     \]  
     Assuming constant speed,  
     \[
     \text{TTC} = \frac{28.92}{9.10} \approx 3.18 \text{ sec}
     \]  
     The TTC is less than our safety threshold of 4 seconds, indicating a potential risk of collision.

2. **Right Lane Change Feasibility:**
   - The vehicle ahead in the right lane (`344`) is `37.32 m` ahead, traveling at `21.73 m/s`. 
   - The vehicle behind in the right lane (`392`) is `10.86 m` behind, traveling at `15.59 m/s`.
   - Attempting a right lane change is marked as unsafe due to potential collision with nearby vehicles.

3. **Current Lane Decisions:**
   - With a TTC of 3.18 seconds, maintaining current speed ("Idle") is not advisable.
   - Based on the action utility analysis, acceleration is declared unsafe due to increased risk of collision with vehicle `256`.
   - Deceleration is recommended for creating safer distance, reducing TTC, and lowering collision risk.

Final action: `#### 4`
