The ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane and aims to reach the rightmost lane safely. However, there is significant distance ahead to the target, suggesting that we must first ensure the basic safety and positional goals before making strategic lane choices.

You are too close to the vehicle `256` ahead of you in your lane. The distance is only `14.50 m`, and your speed is `16.42 m/s` compared to `15.55 m/s` of vehicle `256`. Considering the situation, maintain proper distance and speed to avoid collision is priority.

According to Action Utility Analysis, decelerating is safe and recommended because it helps to increase the timeout time to collision (TTC), which is currently at a lower threshold due to close distance. Other actions such as accelerating or idling would not be appropriate given the close proximity to the vehicle ahead and could increase the risk of collision.

Final action: `#### 4`
