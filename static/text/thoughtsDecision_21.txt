The current situation is as follows:

1. You are currently in the second lane from the left (lane 2), but to reach the target area, you must be in the rightmost lane (lane 4).

2. There is a vehicle ahead of you in the current lane (Vehicle `392`) at a distance of `25.85 m` which is traveling at a higher speed than you, creating a potential risk if you maintain your current speed or accelerate. Therefore, maintaining speed or accelerating is not advisable.

3. Right lane change is deemed unsafe due to the proximity of Vehicle `104` ahead and Vehicle `624` behind in the right lane. An attempt to change to the right lane could result in a collision with these vehicles.

4. Deceleration is recommended because it will increase the distance between you and Vehicle `392`, reducing the risk of a collision.

5. As you cannot safely make a right lane change and the recommended action is to decelerate, it is essential to first manage the speed and spacing to ensure safety and create space for future manoeuvers.

Final action: `#### 4`
