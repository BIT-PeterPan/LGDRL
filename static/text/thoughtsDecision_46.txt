The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which is the designated goal zone. Therefore, the priority is to maintain a safe distance and speed in relation to the vehicles ahead in the same lane.

1. The vehicle ahead (`688`) is `42.70 m` away, traveling faster at `19.46 m/s` compared to the ego-vehicle's current speed of `17.58 m/s`. The speed difference suggests that the vehicle ahead is pulling away, reducing the risk of a collision and maintaining an appropriate time-to-collision (TTC). Our current TTC is much greater than 4 seconds based on the relative speeds and distance.

2. Since the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost lane, no lane change is necessary. There is no option to change to a lane on the right, as there is no lane available there.

3. Considering the available actions, the Action Utility Analysis recommends acceleration to catch up with the vehicle ahead due to being far from the this lead vehicle.

After analyzing the situation and based on the conditions above, the ego-vehicle should accelerate to maintain a better positioning in the flow of traffic in the rightmost lane.

Final action: `#### 3`
