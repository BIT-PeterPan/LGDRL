Based on Action Utility Analysis, changing to the right lane is deemed unsafe. Vehicle `688` is very close to the ego vehicle from behind on the right lane, which could lead to a collision if a lane change is attempted.

The distance to the vehicle ahead (Vehicle `624`) in the current lane is only `19.12 m`, with a significant speed difference, as the front vehicle is moving faster than the ego vehicle. This leads to a slight risk, although TTC is on the line of safety, it could grow less than 4 if not under control.

Remaining idle (Action_id: 1) or accelerating (Action_id: 3) is not advisable, since both are marked as unsafe in Action Utility Analysis due to the proximity to the vehicle in front and potential collision.

Deceleration is recommended with a safe evaluation. This will allow maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and adjust speed for any actions required to create space for an eventual right lane change.

Final action: `#### 4`
