The ego-vehicle is currently in the second lane from the left with a current speed of `10.63 m/s`. Vehicle `392` is `20.94 m` ahead in the same lane, traveling at a speed of `19.31 m/s`. This indicates that the ego-vehicle is quite close to the vehicle ahead given the speed difference.

Since the current priority is to maintain an appropriate distance from the vehicle ahead and the given Action Utility Analysis suggests deceleration as the safe and recommended action, we should consider reducing speed to increase the gap with Vehicle `392`.

The ultimate objective is to change lanes to the rightmost lane safely. However, the right lane change is currently unsafe due to the presence of Vehicle `104` only `36.93 m` ahead and Vehicle `624` just `10.55 m` behind in the right lane, making it unwise to change lanes at this moment without creating adequate space.

Improving the space with the front vehicle by decelerating will also contribute indirectly to addressing future lane change opportunities safely.

Final action: `#### 4`
