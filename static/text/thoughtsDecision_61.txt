Given the current situation, the ego-vehicle is in the rightmost lane and there is no option to change to the right lane. 

The car ahead (vehicle `688`) is only `15.24 m` in front, which is too close to maintain a safe distance, especially considering the slight speed advantage of the ego-vehicle (`21.05 m/s` vs. `20.19 m/s`). This makes actions like Idle or Accelerate unsafe due to the risk of collision. 

According to the action utility analysis, Accelerate is deemed unsafe and Idle is also considered unsafe due to proximity to vehicle `688`. 

The Decelerate action is marked as safe and recommended to avoid a collision since it increases the distance between the ego-vehicle and the vehicle in front. 

The focus here is clearly on safety while the ego-vehicle is already in the rightmost laneâ€”it just needs to maintain a safe distance from the car in front. 

Final action: `#### 4`
