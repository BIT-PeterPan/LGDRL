The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane. According to the initial preference, if you're already in the rightmost lane, you should stay in this lane. 

Next, evaluate the appropriate distance and speed with the car in front. Vehicle `688` is `41.73 m` ahead with a speed of `19.36 m/s`. The ego-vehicle is slower at `16.42 m/s`. The Time-to-Collision (TTC) can be computed to be more than 4 seconds without any impending collision.

The distance from Vehicle `688` is appropriate based on the given TTC value, but since the Action Utility suggests that accelerating is recommended to catch up due to being too far from the front vehicle, this indicates that increasing speed to balance the gap is favorable.

A right lane change isn't possible since there is no lane to the right, and maintaining distance at a higher speed is safe and recommended.

Therefore, based on this analysis, accelerating is not only safe but recommended to reduce the distance to the vehicle ahead while still maintaining a safe condition.

Final action: `#### 3`
