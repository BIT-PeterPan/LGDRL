The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane.

The vehicle in front (Vehicle `688`) is `20.76 m` ahead and is moving slower than the ego vehicle at a speed of `20.09 m/s`. This close distance combined with the speed difference makes it important to avoid a potential collision.

As we are already in the rightmost lane, we cannot perform any lane change action (such as changing to the right).

Since acceleration is deemed unsafe and there isn't enough distance for the Idle action to be safe, we must consider decelerating to avoid getting too close to Vehicle `688` and maintain a safe time-to-collision (TTC).

Based on the Action Utility Analysis, deceleration is both safe and recommended in this scenario.

Final action: `#### 4`
