The ego-vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, so there is no option to change to a lane to the right. We must remain in this lane.

Vehicle `688` is `18.50 m` ahead of us, with a speed of `20.12 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is higher at `24.53 m/s`, which means we are closing in on vehicle `688` quickly.

The TTC (Time to Collision) with vehicle `688` can be calculated: 
TTC = Distance / (Speed of ego-vehicle - Speed of vehicle `688`) = 18.5 / (24.53 - 20.12) = 4.51 seconds.
The TTC is slightly above 4, which is marginal but could become unsafe as it decreases. However, maintaining this TTC requires action due to the speed difference.

The Action Utility Analysis suggests deceleration is safe and recommended to maintain a safe distance from vehicle `688`. Acceleration and Idle are unsafe due to the collision risk. A left lane change, while safe, is unnecessary as our goal is to remain in the rightmost lane.

Final action: `#### 4`
