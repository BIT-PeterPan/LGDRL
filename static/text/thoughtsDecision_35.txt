Firstly, I need to maintain an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front of me. The car in front of me on my current lane is Vehicle `624` which is `31.08 m` away, moving at a speed of `17.66 m/s`. My current speed is `8.32 m/s` which creates a significant difference allowing me to stay below Vehicle `624`'s speed, thus, maintaining an acceptable distance over time without colliding given their acceleration status. However, I must ensure the distance is not diminishing too fast, as it's noted to be recommended to decelerate to avoid getting too close. 

Next, about changing lanes right: My target is the rightmost lane and given the scenario, I am in the third lane with an option to move to the second lane. There are two vehicles on the right lane, Vehicle `688` ahead at `7.65 m` at a speed of `17.65 m/s`, and Vehicle `784` at `40.91 m` with a speed of `15.92 m/s`. Given these distances and speeds, the right lane change is unsafe and may lead to a collision, thus I cannot proceed to change lanes safely now.

In the rightmost lane is my target which is `257.0 m` ahead, and I need to eventually move towards it. However, the immediate attempt to change to the right is not viable. The left lane change is marked safe, but the objective remains to move right, ruling out lateral movement to the left.

The recommended action is to decelerate to adjust speed and maintain a safe space with the vehicle ahead, following the action utility analysis. This would allow for an eventual opportunity to safely adjust and attempt a lane change when the right conditions arrive.

Deceleration would ensure I stay within safe stopping distances and prepare to eventually move rightwards when conditions clear.

Final action: `#### 4`
