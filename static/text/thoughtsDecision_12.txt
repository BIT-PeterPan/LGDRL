Based on the given information, the ego vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane with a vehicle just `15.48 m` ahead moving at a speed of `16.03 m/s`. The ego vehicle's speed is `14.11 m/s`, so it should maintain a safe time-to-collision (TTC) and distance. Given the TTC and distance constraints, immediate action is required for safety.

The action utility analysis suggests that changing to the right lane is unsafe due to the vehicles in the right lane, and accelerating could cause a collision as the ego vehicle is too close to the vehicle ahead.

Deceleration is marked as safe and recommended because it will increase the distance and TTC with the vehicle ahead.

Final action: `#### 4`
