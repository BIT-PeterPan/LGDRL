The ego-vehicle is in the leftmost lane and the vehicle ahead (Vehicle `256`) is only `15.06 m` away, with a speed of `15.28 m/s`. The ego-vehicle's speed is `17.58 m/s`, which is faster than Vehicle `256`, increasing the risk of collision. The ego-vehicle must ensure appropriate time-to-collision (TTC) above 4 seconds, currently potentially low due to proximity and speed differential.

A safe right lane change is not possible since it has been identified as unsafe in the Action Utility Analysis. Vehicle `344` is `41.41 m` ahead, traveling faster than the ego-vehicle, which is good distance-wise but changing lanes might still risk a collision because of vehicle dynamics. Behind, Vehicle `392` is close enough at `18.71 m`, traveling slightly faster, making a right lane change infeasible without creating more space.

Accelerating is not safe since it would decrease the distance to the vehicle ahead too quickly, risking a collision further.

Remaining idle is also considered unsafe, as the current speed is faster than Vehicle `256`, which is too close, thus not maintaining a safe TTC.

Deceleration is recommended because it increases the distance to Vehicle `256`, enhancing safety. The Action Utility Analysis mentions deceleration as safe and preferable due to the fact that it's necessary to maintain a safe distance and avoid a potential collision with Vehicle `256`.

Final action: `#### 4`
