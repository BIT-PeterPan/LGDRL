Given the current situation:

1. **Maintaining Distance and Speed with Front Vehicle:**
   - The vehicle ahead (`392`) is `36.33 m` away with a speed of `19.39 m/s`.
   - Your current speed is `9.47 m/s` which is significantly lower than the vehicle in front.
   - Time to collision (TTC) with vehicle `392` is greater than 4 seconds due to the speed difference, ensuring safety with respect to this vehicle.

2. **Right Lane Change:**
   - The analysis indicates that changing lanes to the right is unsafe due to proximity to vehicle `624` which is just `0.81 m` behind in the adjacent lane.
   - Therefore, it is currently not safe to perform a right lane change.

3. **Maintaining Current Lane:**
   - Since the right lane change is unsafe and the vehicle ahead has a higher speed, maintaining the current lane is appropriate if no further immediate action can be safely taken to move right.

4. **Speed Adjustment:**
   - The analysis recommends accelerating as it is safe and will help in closing the gap to the vehicle ahead (`392`).
   - Acceleration will also keep options open for future maneuvers when the right lane becomes safe.

Final action: `#### 3`
