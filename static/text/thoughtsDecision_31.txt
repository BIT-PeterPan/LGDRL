Given the provided information, I will guide the decision based on the step-by-step instructions and the given data.

1. Firstly, we need to ensure an appropriate distance and speed from the car ahead in the current lane. The vehicle `624` is only `16.33 m` ahead of the ego-vehicle, and given its speed (`17.36 m/s`) compared to the ego-vehicle's (`12.95 m/s`), the Time-to-Collision (TTC) is quite low. According to the Action Utility Analysis, the situation is unsafe as the distance is too short, and deceleration is recommended to avoid collision.

2. Secondly, we analyze the option for a right lane change. However, it is deemed unsafe based on the Action Utility Analysis, indicating there could be a potential collision. Specifically, vehicle `688` behind in the right lane is too close (`6.23 m`), which makes changing lanes an unsafe action at this point.

3. Ego-vehicle is not yet in the rightmost lane, but attempting a change is unsafe for now.

4. Safe and recommended action, according to the Action Utility Analysis, is to decelerate to create more distance from the vehicle ahead and ensure safety.

Final action: `#### 4`
