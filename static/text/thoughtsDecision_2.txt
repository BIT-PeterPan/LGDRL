The ego-vehicle is currently in the leftmost lane and needs to eventually reach the rightmost lane, in which the target is located. 

Let's first check the distance to the vehicle ahead in the current lane and consider the Time to Collision (TTC). The car `256` is 36.91m ahead, moving at `16.27 m/s`, and decelerating. Although the vehicle's speed is less than the ego-vehicleâ€™s speed (`22.21 m/s`), the ego vehicle's speed difference is significant. To maintain a safe distance, we might consider deceleration or maintaining speed, given the acceleration capability and current speed situation.

Next, check the possibility of a lane change to the right. Vehicle `344` is 38.80m ahead on the right lane, moving at `21.98 m/s` with slight deceleration. A safe gap must be ensured for a successful maneuver. Vehicle `392` is quite close behind the ego-car on the right lane at a distance of 4.10m and moving considerably slower. Attempting to change lanes immediately might not be safe due to this closeness.

Since the action utility analysis marked the right lane change as unsafe, and recommended the idle mode, it would be reasonable and safe to maintain the current speed.

Final Action: `#### 1`
