Since you are in the rightmost lane, you should stay in this lane. There is no option for a right lane change since there is no lane on your right. The focus should now be on maintaining an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front of you. 

1. You are `37.24 m` behind Vehicle `688` which is moving at `19.89 m/s`. Your speed is `24.53 m/s`, which means you are closing the gap at a speed of `4.64 m/s`.
2. Use the concept of Time-to-Collision (TTC). Current TTC = 37.24 / 4.64 = 8.03 seconds.
3. Since TTC > 4, you are not too close to the vehicle ahead, but you could adjust your speed for better efficiency.
4. According to the Action Utility Analysis, accelerating is safe and recommended since you are too far from the front vehicle and can catch up with it. This should be a safe operation as long as the frontal space permits a safe distance approaching Vehicle `688` optimally.

Final action: `#### 3`
