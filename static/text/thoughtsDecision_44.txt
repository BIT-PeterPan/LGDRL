Since you are already in the rightmost lane, according to the guidance, you should stay in this lane and ensure an appropriate distance and speed difference with the car in front. 

1. The car ahead of the ego-vehicle in the same lane is Vehicle `688`, which is `40.23 m` away traveling at a speed of `19.25 m/s`. The ego-vehicle speed is `15.26 m/s`, which is slower than the car ahead. Therefore, accelerating to close the gap while ensuring a safe following distance is appropriate.
   
2. The Time to Collision (TTC) is given by the formula: 
   \[ \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{distance to the vehicle ahead}}{\text{speed difference}} \]
   Given the current speed difference of approximately `4.01 m/s` (19.25 - `15.26 m/s`), the TTC is \( \frac{40.23}{4.01} \approx 10.03 \) seconds, which is larger than the minimum requirement of 4.

3. Action Utility Analysis suggests that accelerating is safe and recommended because the ego-vehicle is too far from the vehicle in front.

4. There is no option to change to the right lane as it does not exist. Left lane change is safe, but not recommended since the goal is to stay in the rightmost lane.

Final action: `#### 3`
