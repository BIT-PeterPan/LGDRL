The ego vehicle is currently in the rightmost lane, which aligns with the goal of reaching the designated area.

The vehicle in front of the ego at a distance of `15.34 m` is moving at a slightly higher speed (`20.21 m/s`) than the ego (`19.89 m/s`), meaning the distance between the ego and the lead vehicle is likely to increase over time. However, the current distance is close, and with the action utility analysis marking idle and acceleration as unsafe, we must prioritize safety.

Decreasing speed through deceleration is safe and recommended due to the proximity of the lead vehicle. Deceleration will ensure an appropriate distance is maintained, preventing any potential collision.

Although changing to the left lane is considered safe, the ego vehicle is already in the designated rightmost lane, so changing lanes is unnecessary and does not align with the goal.

Final action: `#### 4`
