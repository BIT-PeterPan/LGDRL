First, let's analyze the distance and speed differential with the car in front of us on our current lane. Vehicle `624` is `38.85 m` ahead with a speed of `17.76 m/s`, while our speed is `10.63 m/s`. The Time to Collision (TTC) calculation is:

\[
TTC = \text{Distance} / (\text{Speed of vehicle ahead} - \text{Ego speed})
\]
\[
TTC = 38.85 / (17.76 - 10.63) = 38.85 / 7.13 \approx 5.45
\]

Since the TTC is greater than 4, maintaining the current distance with the vehicle in front is appropriate.

Next, assess the possibility of a right lane change. The Vehicle `688` is ahead in the right lane by `15.59 m` and is moving at a speed of `18.12 m/s`, while Vehicle `784` is behind by `34.62 m` at a speed of `16.54 m/s`. A right lane change is deemed safe and recommended by the utility analysis.

Since the right lane change is both safe and recommended, and you're not currently in the rightmost lane, you should take this opportunity to change to the right lane.

Final action: `#### 2`
